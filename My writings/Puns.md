###### All these but 
- All these Onions, but you make me cry. 
- All these items, still we couldn't build a relationship
- All these lemons, but you threw me under the bus
- All these drinks, but you consumed my energy
- All these slippers, but you wore me out
- All these crayons but still couldn't draw your attention
- All these balls, but you wanted to play with mine
- All these windows, but you sneaked into my life
- All these guns, but you chose to trigger me
- All these cycles, but I wanna break yours
- All these wires, but still couldn't connect you with me
- All these wires but still couldn't intertwine you with me
- All these vegetables, but you cut my call
- All these birds on the day of holi but still couldn't pass with flying colours
- All these buttons but still couldn't imPRESS you
- All these terms and conditions, but you ignored me
- All these men but you chose to blow balloons
- All these routes, but still couldn't reach you. 


##### Bengaluru Traffic 
- Are you Bengaluru's Traffic? cuz many are waiting for your green signal.
- Are you Bengalur's Traffic? cuz it's a turn off when you turn red. 
- Are you Bengaluru's Traffic? cuz people go HORNy when you set them free. 
- Are you Bengaluru's Traffic? cuz you don't let me move on. 
- Are you Bengaluru's traffic? Cuz I get stuck when I am near you.
