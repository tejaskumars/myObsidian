prenote :- 
We wirte emails regularly to different people, we need to watch our words accordingly, however be polite to everyone. Like any other skill, email writing is also one of the skills, We need to articulate our sentences properly. We should make the other person feel easy not weird. What I am expected to learn here is, basic rules and sanitation needs to be followed, what words are appropriate at what situations like the trivial ones. 


- The subject line should be an Action sentence, if there is a time constartint, be it with it. Ex :- '[Proposal Approval] Acceptance Letter from Mindstree org.'
- In the body, have the main content first followed up by the context not vice versa. But always end with a thanking note. 
- But if the person has no clue, it's advisable to go with relative context first and then main content. 
- Have a maximum of four paragraphs, and let each paragraph explain only one point. 
- Do not use contractions like don't, haven't , I'm etc.
